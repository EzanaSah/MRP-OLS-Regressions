2020-02-24T05:00:00Z,"On February 24, 2020, estimates of Quebec and Canada after-tax income for 2017 were corrected, leading to a revison of the low income measure (LIM) after-tax thresholds for 2017. As a result, LIM estimates were revised for all geographies, while Market Basket Measure (MBM) and after-tax low income cut-off (LICO) estimates were revised for Quebec, Canada and Quebec census metropolitan areas."

6,"An economic family refers to a group of two or more persons who live in the same dwelling and are related to each other by blood, marriage, common-law, adoption or a foster relationship."
7,"Low income measures (LIMs), are relative measures of low income, set at 50% of adjusted median household income. These measures are categorized according to the number of persons present in the household, reflecting the economies of scale inherent in household size."
8,"The low income cut-offs after tax (LICO-AT) are income thresholds below which a family will likely devote a larger share of its after-tax income on the necessities of food, shelter and clothing than the average family. The approach is essentially to estimate an income threshold at which families are expected to spend 20 percentage points more than the average family on food, shelter and clothing, based on the 1992 Family Expenditures Survey. LICOs are calculated in this manner for seven family sizes and five community sizes."
9,"The low income cut-offs before tax (LICO-BT) are income thresholds below which a family will likely devote a larger share of its before-tax income on the necessities of food, shelter and clothing than the average family. The approach is essentially to estimate an income threshold at which families are expected to spend 20 percentage points more than the average family on food, shelter and clothing, based on the 1992 Family Expenditures Survey. LICOs are calculated in this manner for seven family sizes and five community sizes."
